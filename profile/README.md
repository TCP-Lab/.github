# Welcome to the Turin Cell Physiology Lab!

## Who are you?
We are a small team of bioinformaticians working for the University of Turin, based in Turin, Italy. Our team is outlined below.
We are part of a bigger organization, the Turin Cell Physiology Lab (TCP-Lab), where we study a wide range of subjects, but mostly centered around cancer and general physiology.
You can find CMA-Lab's ResearchGate page [here](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Luca-Munaron-Lab).

## Where are you?
We are based in the Department of Life Sciences and Systems Biology, in Via Accademia Albertina, 13, Turin, Italy.

## What do you do?
We are currently interested in understanding the role of ion channels and transporters in Cancer and other diseases.
Being physiologists by heart, we are mostly interested in the physiological changes of cancer.
Here are some of our projects.

### 🛠️ Current Projects
- 📜 [MTP-DB](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/MTP-DB), a database for transporters.
- 🧫 [Transportome Profiler](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/transportome_profiler), a pipeline for the transportome analysis.
- 🔧 [x.FASTQ](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/x.FASTQ), Bash wrapper modules for the remote analysis of RNA-Seq data.
- 📤 [SeqLoader](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/SeqLoader), constructors and methods for _xSeries_ and _xModel_ S3 classes

### 📚 Data
- 📖 [ICT.bib](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/ICT.bib), a systematic compilation of all works about the transportome, or transportome-related.
- 📕 [Handbook](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/handbook), the TCP-Lab handbook of useful things.

### 🏋️ Active Maintenance
- 🧬 [BioTEA](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/bioTEA) and [BioTEA-box](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/bioTEA-box), the DEA runners.
- 🧰 [r4tcpl](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/r4tcpl), a collection of utility R functions.
- 🧮 [DeNumerator](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/DeNumerator), an R package to enumerate the categories of DEGs in a factorial design.
- 🔎 [compare_ranks](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/compare_ranks), an R package to compare the order of two sorted lists.

### ✅ Finished
- 🌊 [kym](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/kym), a wavelet-based analysis tool.
- 📐 [MORPHEUS](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/MORPHEUS), ImageJ plugin for morphometry.
