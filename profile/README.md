# Welcome to the Turin Cell Physiology Lab!

## Who are you?
We are a small team of bioinformaticians working for the University of Turin, based in Turin, Italy.
Our team is outlined below.
We are part of a bigger organization, the Turin Cell Physiology Lab (TCP-Lab), where we study a wide range of subjects, but mostly centered around cancer and general physiology.

## Where are you?
We are based in the Department of Life Sciences and Systems Biology (DBIOS), in Via Accademia Albertina, 13, Turin, Italy.

## What do you do?
We are currently interested in understanding the role of ion channels and transporters in cancer and other diseases.
Being cell physiologists by heart, we are mostly interested in cell signaling mechanisms, particularly those involving intracellular calcium concentration changes and transmembrane ion currents.
Here are some of our projects.

### 🛠️ Current Projects
- 📜 [MTP-DB](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/MTP-DB), a comprehensive database for transporters.
- 🧫 [Transportome Profiler](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/transportome_profiler), a general pipeline for the transportome analysis.
- 🧬 [x.FASTQ](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/x.FASTQ), Bash wrapper modules for the remote analysis of RNA-Seq data.
- 🩸 [Endothelion](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/Endothelion), a large-scale comparison of ICT expression in healthy endothelium.
- ⚡ [pancreon](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/pancreon), channelome profiling and whole-cell current analysis in PANC-1 cell line.
- 🧱 [SeqLoader](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/SeqLoader), constructors and methods for _xSeries_ and _xModel_ S3 classes.
- 📈 [TRaceR](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/TRaceR), analyzer of intracellular calcium time-course data, with collapse events.

### 📚 Data
- 📖 [ICT.bib](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/ICT.bib), a systematic compilation of all scientific works around the transportome.
- 📕 [Handbook](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/handbook), the TCP-Lab handbook of useful things.

### 🏋️ Active Maintenance
- 🧬 [BioTEA](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/bioTEA) and [BioTEA-box](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/bioTEA-box), the DEA runners for microarray expression data.
- 🧰 [r4tcpl](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/r4tcpl), a collection of utility R functions (TCP-Lab R library).
- 🧮 [DeNumerator](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/DeNumerator), an R package to enumerate the categories of DEGs in a factorial design.
- 🔎 [compare_ranks](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/compare_ranks), an R package to compare the order of two sorted lists.
- 🗳️ [kondorcet](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/kondorcet), a tool to compute the Condorcet Ranking with Copeland's method quickly.
- 📊 [lytiks](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/lytiks), fetcher of journal metrics and analytics of interest from Scopus and WoS.

### ✅ Finished
- 🌊 [kym](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/kym), a wavelet-based analysis tool.
- 📐 [MORPHEUS](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/MORPHEUS), ImageJ plugin for morphometry.
